# ANSI-Comment-Converter
Converts C++ style comments to C comments

Often times we are confronted with professors that enforce strict C standards from the 80s. One major downfall of this approach is having to type comments of the following format
<code>/* this is a comment */</code>
instead of the preferred C++ style comments:
<code>// this is a comment </code>

This program simply aims to convert from the C++ style comments to the C style comments by duplicating your file.

<h6>Usage</h6>
<code>java Converter [path-to-input-file] [path-to-output-file]</code>

The output will be generated by the program.
